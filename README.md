# BruteCode

This is a simple educational tool designed to demonstrate how a basic password brute force attack could work. It randomly generates passwords and checks them against a user input to see how many attempts it takes to 'guess' the password.

## Description

The script provides a straightforward interface for selecting the type of characters that the password is composed of (e.g., alphanumeric, numeric, etc.), and then it will proceed to attempt to 'crack' the password by generating combinations randomly.

## Installation

Before running the script, you need to install the required Python packages. You can install all the dependencies by running the following command:

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To run the script, simply clone this repository or download the `.py` file to your local machine. Run the script using Python:

```bash
python3 BruteCode.py
```

## Credits

Developed as an educational script. Any similarities to actual password cracking tools are purely coincidental.
